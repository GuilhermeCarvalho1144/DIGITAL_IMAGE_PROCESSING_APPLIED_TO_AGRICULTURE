This work is a proposal of
algorithm for counting and recognizing
lines of lettuce plantations. The problem
was divided into two algorithms, the first
determined the number of plants and
lines where the lettuces plant plants,
using the Hough transform. Already the
second program focuses on counting
plants germinated in a sowing,
for this makes use of a change of pattern
RGB color for HSV, showing the
thus facilitating the counting. All
the codes are in .m files within that repository.
